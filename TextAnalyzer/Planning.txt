Write a text analyzer that reads a file and outputs statistics about that file. It should output the word frequencies of all words in the file, sorted by the most frequently used word. The output should be a set of pairs, each pair containing a word and how many times it occurred in the file.

---- TextAnalyzer.java ----

REQUIREMENT
	FILE .txt as input
	WORD_OBJECT of each unique words (non-case sensitive) with frequency counter
	LIST of WORD_OBJECTs
	OUTPUT Sorted by highest word count descending

SAMPLE OUTPUT
	THE, 100
	AT, 97
	...
	MELLOW, 1
	
OUTLINE
	1. Open and Read from FILE
	2. Store the words read from FILE into LIST where each unique word is an object
	3a. If word is not yet in LIST, insantiate a new WORD_OBJECT and add it
	3b. If word is already in LIST, find and update the corresponding WORD_OBJECT with INCREMENT_METHOD
	4. Loop through LIST outputting each WORD_OBJECT in descending order of frequency count
